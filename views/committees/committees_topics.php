Its main goal is to strengthen security and defence cooperation among the member-States in order to achieve sustainable and permanent peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region.  The forum is compounded by the ten ASEAN countries and eight others, called “Dialogue Partners”, turning it into a more comprehensive platform to deal with the defence challenges of the region.<br/>The ADMM+ was established during Vietnam’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2010 and since then there were held three ministerial meetings. Besides that, ADMM+ has remained extremely active, holding annual meetings of senior officials and showing substantial military cooperation developed by its Groups of Experts. The committee has six groups within which the Members debate about the following topics: Maritime Security, Counter-terrorism, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Management, Peacekeeping Operations, Humanitarian Mine Action and Military Medicine.<br/>Acknowledging that the Asia-Pacific region faces several challenges ahead, the ADMM+ makes a very important contribution to stability and prosperity by building trust and confidence among the regional defence forces. All the eighteen Member States participate in the meeting, all represented by their Defence Ministers, who are expected to achieve by consensus a joint statement.',

            'description' => 'The World Bank Group (WBG) is an independent specialized agency of the United Nations system which works to diminish poverty levels and support sustainable development strategies. It is an association of five development institutions that provide technical and financial assistance to member countries. Among these institutions, the two main ones are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA).<br/>Every country that takes part of one of the aforementioned institutions is represented in two main decision organs of the World Bank Group: the Board of Governors, and the Board of Executive Directors. The Board of Governors is the ultimate policy maker of the World Bank Group and is composed of all countries’ finance authorities, who meet once a year. The Executive Directors have specific duties delegated by the Board of Governors. Four of the five institutions that form the World Bank Group have a Board of Executive Directors - the exception is the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which has an autonomous structure. The four Boards of Executive Directors decide on proposals to be implemented by their respective institutions. They meet regularly at the Bank’s headquarters in Washington, United States.<br/>The XIV UFRGSMUN is going to simulate the Board of Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The IBRD is the earliest institution of the World Bank Group, founded after the ratification of the Bretton Woods Agreement, in 1944. Post-war reconstruction of Europe was its original objective, but its focus has evolved into assisting middle-income and creditworthy low-income countries. To that end, the IBRD provides low-interest loans decided upon by its Board. Twenty five executive directors compose the Board and represent the 188 member countries of the IBRD. Each of the five largest shareholders in the World Bank Group - France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States - appoints one executive director to the Board. China, the Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia also indicate their own representatives. The remaining 17 executive directors are elected to represent each a determined group of countries.',
